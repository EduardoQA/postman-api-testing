# CRUD Testing with Postman #



This project contains a demonstration of automated execution of "CRUD" methods by creating boards within "Your workspace" on the Trello website
and you can follow in real time as the execution happens by accessing [here](https://trello.com/u/eduardolemes22/boards).

## How To Run The Test ##

```
# Import the "Trello APIs.postman_collection.json" file into the Postman
# Click on the three dots in the "Trello APIs" collection and click on "Run Colection" and set the Run Configuration as you wish.
# Execute the Collection Runner to see the results.
# (Bonus) You can also go to "https://trello.com/u/eduardolemes22/boards" to see the CRUD process happening while the collection is running.



```

## Here I also added some tests generally used in this tool ##
